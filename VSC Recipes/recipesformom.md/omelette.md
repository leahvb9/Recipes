# Omelette
## Tools:

- Nonstick pan (found in the drawer under the oven) 
- Spatula (found in the drawer on the left side of the sink) 
- Pam cooking spray (found in the cabinet above the stove) 
- Mixing bowl (found in the cabinet on the left side of the sink) 

## Ingredients:
- Eggs (x2)
- Butter (½ tbsp)
- Milk 
- Onion 
- Shredded pepper jack cheese  
- Salt and pepper 

## Directions:
### Preparation:
1. Dice 1/4 of an onion.
2. In the mixing bowl, combine eggs, a splash of milk, and salt and pepper to taste.
3. Whisk egg mixture to try to get air into the mixture. 

### Cook:
1. Place the nonstick pan on the stove on medium heat, allow the pan to heat up for about two minutes. 
2. Melt the butter in the pan. 
3. When the butter stops bubbling, add the onion. 
4. Cook the onions until softened. 
   - NOTE: We do not want to brown or caramelize the onions, they will likely be softened within one to two minutes.
5. Shake the pan so the onions are evenly distributed throughout the pan. 
6. Pour the egg mixture over the onion. 
7. Move the pan around so the egg is evenly dispersed throughout the pan. 
8. Let the egg cook for two minutes until cooked through. 
- `NOTE`: To know when the egg is done, move the pan around- if there is any egg moving, it is not ready. When the egg is done, it will be easy to separate the egg from the pan using a spatula. You should be able to put the spatula completely under the egg. The egg will be golden brown, as shown in the picture.  
9. Place the shredded pepper jack cheese on one side of the egg. 
10. Carefully, using the spatula, fold the other side of the egg over the cheese side. 
- `Note`: There is a possibility the egg will break while folding it over. Don’t worry, it will still taste great- it just may not be as pretty!  
11. Turn off the heat and let sit for one minute. 

### Enjoy
1. Remove from the pan, season again with salt and pepper to taste. 
2. Enjoy!
